\missingfigure{graph showing linear transport as intersection between different fields.}

\todo[inline]{Large Body of Work on very similar problems exist in other fields.}

\todo[inline]{Translational research important contributor to scientific advances. Translation, reframing, enhancing, adopting.}

\todo[inline]{Example: Deon, Quantized diffusion, Zero Variance. Russian roulette and splitting stuff.}

\todo[inline]{This work follows the same path.}

\section{Deterministic Methods based on Spherical Harmonics Expansion}

\todo[inline]{Explain deterministic methods and discretization on a high level.}

\todo[inline]{Explain spherical harmonics based disretization.}

\section{Research Questions}

\todo[inline]{How can SH based methods in other domains be applied to the problem of rendering in graphics?}

\section{Contributions and Outline}
\todo[inline]{Mention, that the real-valued PN equation is a contribution}
