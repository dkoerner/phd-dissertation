\section{Derivation}

\todo[inline]{We do not mention the moment problem here. We just show the derivation of the diffusion approximation, by truncating at $N=1$ and inserting $P_1$-equations into $P_0$-equation. This way we can leave the moment problem entirely to the FLD chapter.}
\todo[inline]{Explain/Visualize the idea behind diffusion approximation: to approximate global transport by using a local gradient of the fluence}
