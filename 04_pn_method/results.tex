\section{Results}
\label{sec:pn_results}

\TD{pointsource test. give point source analytical solutions from QD paper. explain why it is good as a reference.}
\TD{nebulae. explain setup and indirect illumination and vacuum region. maybe discuss how it was build? show solutions for p1-p5 and give tables with performance and memory statistics. give all pictures including results.}
\TD{convergence behaviour for different minimum thresholds.}
