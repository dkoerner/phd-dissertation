The $P_N$-method presented in this chapter is a deterministic method for solving the radiative transfer equation. It is based on the spherical harmonics discretization of the radiative transfer equation and its related quantities in the angular domain. 

This chapter will give a thorough derivation of the $P_N$-theory and also devise a method for solving the underlying equations. The first section introduces the spherical harmonics expansion and its important properties. The complex-valued $P_N$-equations are derived in section~\ref{sec:pn_cvalued}. The fact, that the radiance field is real-valued can be used to cut the number of unknown variables in half. This is done by using the real-valued $P_N$-equations. In section~\ref{sec:pn_rvalued}, a compact form of the real-valued $P_N$-equations are derived, which, to the author's best knowledge, has not been given anywhere else in the literature. After a short note on two-dimensional problems in section~\ref{sec:pn_2d}, the chapter introduces a new method for solving the $P_N$-equations (section~\ref{sec:pn_solver}). The chapter closes by discussing its integration into a rendering framework, and highlights results (section~\ref{sec:pn_results}).
