\chapter{$P_N$-Method for Multiple Scattering in Participating Media}
%
\label{sec:pnmethod}

The $P_N$-method presented in this chapter is a deterministic method for solving the radiative transfer equation. It is based on the spherical harmonics discretization of the radiative transfer equation and its related quantities in the angular domain. 

In this chapter,a thorough derivation of the $P_N$-theory will be given and a novel method for solving the underlying equations introduced. The first section introduces the spherical harmonics expansion and its important properties. The complex-valued $P_N$-equations are derived in section~\ref{sec:pn_cvalued}. The fact, that the radiance field is real-valued can be used to cut the number of unknown in half. This is done by using the real-valued $P_N$-equations. In section~\ref{sec:pn_rvalued}, a compact form of the real-valued $P_N$-equations is derived, which has not been given anywhere else in the literature. After a short note on two-dimensional problems in section~\ref{sec:pn_2d}, the chapter introduces a new method for solving the $P_N$-equations (section~\ref{sec:pn_solver}), closes by discussing its integration into a rendering framework and highlights results (section~\ref{sec:pn_results}).
