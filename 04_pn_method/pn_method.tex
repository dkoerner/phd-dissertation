\chapter{$P_N$-Method for Multiple Scattering in Participating Media}
%
\label{sec:pnmethod}

The $P_N$-method presented in this chapter is a deterministic method for solving the radiative transfer equation. It is based on the spherical harmonics discretization of the radiative transfer equation and its related quantities in angular domain. 

In this chapter, we will give a thorough derivation of the $P_N$-theory and introduce a novel method for solving the underlying equations. The first section introduces the spherical harmonics expansion and important properties. Then the complex-valued $P_N$-equations are derived in section~\ref{sec:pn_cvalued}. The fact, that the radiance field is real-valued can be used to cut the number of unknowns in half. This is done by using the real-valued $P_N$-equations. In section~\ref{sec:pn_rvalued}, a very compact form of the real-valued $P_N$-equations is derived, which has not been given anywhere else in the literature before. After a short note on two-dimensional problems in section~\ref{sec:pn_2d}, The chapter continues by introducing a new method for solving the $P_N$-equations (section~\ref{sec:pn_solver}) and closes by discussing its integration into a rendering framework and giving results (section~\ref{sec:pn_results}).
