The agreement is remarkably good for all values of the parameters. Without being more complicated, the present approximation turns out to be much better than all the formulae previously derived from other approximate theories. In an infinite homogeneous medium, it can be applied in the calculation of the particle density in the presence of a given source distribution. The method by which the formula has been deduced, permits a direct generalization to the case of non-isotropic scattering. Attention is drawn upon the fact that the obtained results could be of basic importance in the development of a more complete formalism, which would also permit the solution of multiple scattering problems in finite media with the same high accuracy.},

            SymPy is an open source computer algebra system written in pure Python. It is built with a focus on extensibility and ease of use, through both interactive and programmatic applications. These characteristics have led SymPy to become a popular symbolic library for the scientific Python ecosystem. This paper presents the architecture of SymPy, a description of its features, and a discussion of select submodules. The supplementary material provide additional examples and further outline details of the architecture and features of SymPy.
