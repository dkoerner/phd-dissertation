This thesis introduces novel numerical methods for light transport simulation in computer graphics, based on the spherical harmonics discretization of angular variables.

Light transport simulation is required for generating realistic images from virtual scenes and therefore is ubiquitous in digital media today. We also see an increasing presence of light transport simulation in the domain of scientific visualization. This is best explained by the fact, that the visual system of humans is optimized for reading real world cues, like surface smoothness from specularity, or shape from indirect illumination. The early stage of realistic image generation in computer graphics relied on ad-hoc techniques and heuristics due to compute power limitations. With the growth of compute capabilities, we saw a steady increase in model accuracy and physical rigor.

Today, the accuracy of human perception defines the domain of light transport simulation in computer graphics and remains the single aspect, which sets it apart from transport simulation in other domains, such as nuclear science or astrophysics. By conforming more and more to traditional physics in terms of models, terminology and methodology, the opportunity opened up to more and more draw inspiration from other fields and their large body of ideas and methods. In fact, an extensive amount of research in light transport simulation for computer graphics is concerned with the translation, reframing and enhancement of those techniques by exploiting limited requirements in accuracy.

In other domains, such as nuclear sciences, astrophysics or medical physics research, the spherical harmonics based angular discretization of the underlying light transport equations led to a large variety of methods. One of those methods, the diffusion approximation, has been introduced to graphics with great success in the past. The reason, why other methods have not been applied in graphics yet is the fact, that the underlying theory is complex and results in large and unwieldy systems of equations. Still, it is important to study them thoroughly and understand their characteristics with regard to applications in computer graphics, where deterministic methods play a significant role and historically have led to major advances in the field.

For the first time, an extensive derivation of the underlying theory of spherical harmonic methods is given and presented in the context of light transport simulation for computer graphics. This thesis takes a deep and holistic view at the whole class of spherical harmonics methods and investigates their application to computer graphics. The result are two novel deterministic methods for solving light transport problems in graphics. The first new method allows for spherical harmonics expansion up to arbitrary level. In order to handle the complex equations, we devise a fully automated discretization framework as part of our solver, which is driven by a computer algebra representation of the underlying transport equations. This novel strategy may inspire new methods for other numerical problems in computer graphics. The second new method, which is introduced in this thesis, is derived by looking at the shortcomings of diffusion approximation and investigating improvements from other domains called flux-limited diffusion. The result is a novel method, which allows for interactive computation of multiple scattering in highly scattering, heterogeneous participating media---a challenging problem for standard Monte-Carlo methods.
